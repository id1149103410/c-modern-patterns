- overhead is 9ms of linker and glibc
- strace -tt shows time in microseconds
- baseline time without stdlib 0.5ms (-ffreestanding -nostdlib)
  #+begin_src c
    // gcc -m32 -ffreestanding -nostdlib
    void _start() {
        /* exit system call */
        asm("movl $1,%eax;"
            "xorl %ebx,%ebx;"
            "int  $0x80"
        );
    }
  #+end_src
- =Bloom filter=, to test SET belongs, for big datasets
  gives false-positive
  do not gives false-negatives

- 1ms in linking
- 5ms in glibc load

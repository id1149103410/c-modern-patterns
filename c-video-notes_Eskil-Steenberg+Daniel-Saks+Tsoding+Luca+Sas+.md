- uses c89, c99 is too new and broken (fixed on c11)
- does NOT use: goto, register, do, continue, auto, volatile
- "ambiguity is the enemy" - in reference to having a programming language that does a thing in 2 lines of code

**Timestamps**

**About C++**
  - it tries to be clever
  - It tries to hide things, not explicit
  - which is the root of all evil
  - Examples:
    - ~operator overloading~
      eg: on vector multiplication: is it dot product or pairwise multiplication?
      where i could have used =vector_dot()= and =vector_mul()=
    - ~overloading~
      eg: what happens when on an add(X,Y) defined on same types. I mix different types?
      where I could have used =addf()=, (ME: like in ocaml)
    - ~on js: undefined field on an object~ the compiler won't complain, it will just return undefined(?)

**words used for naming things**

  - handle, pointer to opaqe data structure
  - func, funtion pointer OR function used as function pointer
  - internal, function internal to a module

**long functions are good**

  - have more code that "does something"
  - instead of code that handles code

**a swedish fighter jet's code has only 1 main(), that calls functions and those functions NEVER call anything else**
  - reduces indirection

**Naming and import("includeing") files**: 
> Start from outside and go in:

  - Have long names, wide code is better, more descriptive
  - words that complement each other: create/destroy, load,unload
  - use:
    - object_action()
    - module_object_action()
  - files:
```

+ Seduce example// Directory: Contains all files that this API has, all started with s_(seduce). 
  |--- .
  |--- ..   
  |--- s_draw_framebuffer.c
  |--- s_draw_new.c
  |--- s_draw_primitive.c
  |--- s_draw.c
  |--- s_draw_internal.h // _INTERNAL.H: file that contains something that you want to communicate within this module, and that external code shouldn't know about.
  |
  |--- s_widget_radial.c
  |--- s_widget_visualizers.c
  |--- s_widget_visualizers_internal.h // _INTERNAL.H: file that contains something that you want to communicate within this module, and that external code shouldn't know about.
  |--- s_widget.c
  |
  |--- s_text_widget.c
  |--- s_text_select.c
  |--- s_text.c
  |
  +--- seduce.h  // EXTERNAL FILE INTERFACE - just one .h file that has loads of functionalities that are defined/implemented in the .c files.
```

**OO in C**

- other languages try to fool that it is something that has both code and data in it
  which is not true on modern systems (aka separate memory spaces)
- object_create()
  object_do_something()
- void pointers are your friend
  - helps creating opaqe types on interfaces (.h) for users of libraries
  - on the public .h
    #+begin_src c
      typedef void RShader
    #+end_src
  - on the internal .h
    #+begin_src c
      typedef struct {
        // ...
      } RShader;
    #+end_src

**Macros 00:50:00**

- Doesn't like them
- One reason to use them is to duplicate A LOT of code for different types
  - still screws the error messages
- To create debug logging macros.
  You can register file/line and create counters for it.
  for malloc() realloc() free()
  #define malloc(n) f_debug_mem_malloc(n, __FILE__, __LINE__)

- C++ dev, working also on C
- 4 Standards C89=C90/C99/C11/C18(bugfix of 11)
- Reserved identifiers
  - for global scope, starting with undersore
  - for all, starting with 2 underscores, or underscore and uppercase
- C99 boolean type
- C90 _STDC_
  C99 _STDC_VERSION_
- C99 long long
- C99 <stdint.h> for exact length ints
- C90 you couldn't declare after the first line
     for loop variables declared at the beginning
  C99 relaxed it, and allows declaration after
     for loop variables declared inplace
- C99 inline for functions
- C99 ~compound literals~, where rational is a typedef struct with 2 members
  (rational){1,2}
  (int [m]){8,6,3,1,2,3,4,5,6}
  (int []){8,6,3,1,2,3,4,5,6}
- C99 ~designated initializers~, nice for unions or structs (to avoid confusion) or arrays
  glop g1 = { .i = 10}
  glop g2 = { .d = 12.3 }
  int x[10] = { 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0,  2}
  int x[10] = { [3] = 8, [7] = 2 }
- C99 ~variable length arrays~ VLAs, declaring and as parameters
  void f(size_t m, size_t n) {
    int x[m][n];
- C99 ~Flexible Array Members~, useful for packet-like structures
  struct packet {
    header h;
    data d[]; // THIS
  }

03:22:00 START

- is like an engine as a library
- a zero initialized structure, is a convention that should be handled
  by the functions handling them
  = {0}

**Example: minimal example**

```c
  #include "raylib.h"
  #define SCREEN_WIDTH 800
  #define SCREEN_HEIGHT 600
  int main(void) {
    InitWindow(SCREEN_WIDTH, SCREEN_HEIGHT, "raylib probe");
    while (!WindowShouldClose()) {
      BeginDrawing();
      CLearBackground(BLACK);
      EndDrawing();
    }
    return 0;
  }

```

- WG14 Standarization Group https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/
- designated initializers, initialize everything else to 0
- header macro to differentiate between c++ and c
  __cplusplus
- Instead using malloc/fopen ask for allocators iocallbacks
- static_assert()
- Example: using sokol gfx, we describe a pipeline, we initialize the others to 0/default
  
```c
  sg_pipeline_desc pip_desc = {
    .layout = {
      .buffers[0].stride = 28,
      .attrs = {
        [ATTR_vs_position].format = SG_VERTEXFORMAT_FLOAT3,
        [ATTR_vs_color0].format   = SG_VERTEXFORMAT_FLOAT4
      }
    },
    .shared = shd,
    .index_type = SG_INDEXTYPE_UINT16,
    .depth_stencil = {
      .depth_compare_func = SG_COMPAREFUNC_LESS_EQUAL,
      .depth_write_enagled = true,
    }
    .rasterizer.cull_mode = SG_CULLMODE_BACK,
    .rasterizer.sample_count = SAMPLE_COUNT,
    .label = "cube-pipeline"
  };

```

- C11 =_Generic= and Overloading
  #define min(a,b) _Generic((a), float. minf(a,b), int: mini(a,b))
- C11 atomics, thread_local
- defer macro

```c
    #define macro_var(name) concat(name, __LINE__)
    #define defer(start,end) for (     \
       int macro_var(_i_) = (start,0); \
       !macro_var(_i_);                \
       (macro_var(_i_) +=, end)
    #define profile defer(profile_begin(), profile_end())
    profile
    {
     ...
    }
    #define gui defer(gui_begin(),gui_end()
    gui
    {
      ...
    }
```

- scope macro
```c
    file_handle_t file = file_open(filename, file_mode_read);
    scope(file_close(file))
    {
      ...
    }
```

- Unions: We can refer to the same thing in different ways
```c
    typedef union hmm_vec2
    {
      struct { float X, Y; };
      struct { float U, V; };
      struct { float Left, Right; };
      struct { float Width, Height; };
      float Elements[2];
    } hmm_vec2;
```

- Error: return a struct with a *valid* field

## 21 | Searching duplicate files with C | Tsoding

00:53:00

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpCJf67e1lI

- Task: Hashing each file
- you can use "(void) varname" to silence warning of unused variable.
- #include <dirent.h>
  - =opendir()=
  - =readdir()= - returns the next entry within the directory
  - =closedir()=
- unix filenames can only be upto 256
- we ignore "." and ".."
  if ((strcmp(ent->d_name, ".") != 0) && strcmp(ent->d_name, "..") != 0)
- string literals are null terminated

```c
    #define PATH_SEP "/" // string literals come with the null termitor character
    #define PATH_SEP_LEN (sizeof(PATH_SEP) - 1)
```

- join_path function, a very c way to append strings with =malloc/memcpy= and pointer adding

```c
  char *join_path(const char *base, const char *file) {
    size_t base_len = strlen(base);
    size_t file_len = strlen(file);

    char *begin = malloc(base_len + file_len + PATH_SEP_LEN + 1);
    assert(begin != NULL);

    char *end = begin;
    memcpy(end, base, base_len);
    end += base_len;
    memcpy(end, PATH_SEP, PATH_SEP_LEN);
    end += PATH_SEP_LEN;
    memcpy(end, file, file_len);
    end += file_len;
    *end = '\0';

    return begin;
  }
```

- to be able to perform an action on each file, WITHOUT interacting with the recursion of readdir()
  we creates a wrapper API struct that keep an array of DIR* around

## 21 | Using C instead of Bash | Tsoding

- =fopen()= returns NULL on error
- =fclose()=
- =fprintf= (SINK,STRING)
  - you can pass to the first argument the FILE *value returned by fopen()
- assert(0 && "TODO: description");
- =fork()=
  - returns
    - to the parent the child id
    - to the child 0
    - or negative on error
- =wait()=
  - waits for state changes in a child of the calling process
  - returns the pid of the process that changed state
- =execvp()=
  - the "p" means that it will look into PATH
  - replaces the current process image with the one passed to it
  - you NEED to run in on a fork()ed child
  - 2nd argument list must end with NULL
- for(; *argv != NULL; argv++) can have a missing initialization parameter
*** shlex
- strchr()
  - locates a character in string
- python shlex.quote, escapes a string to be parsed by a command
- we do string concatenation by
  - doing a single memory allocation of an array of charj
  - and providing an API to memcpy into it cstrings
- gdb

**TODO 1 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCAgvKQDJng**

01:26:00
- uses ~size_t~ for anything related to array indices
- Implementation of C++'s StringView in C https://github.com/tsoding/sv
- fwrite()
- fread() reads elements, not bytes
- using =goto= to return an error, a way to imitate part of Go's "defer"

```c
    char* slurp_file(const char *file_path, size_t *size) {
      FILE *f = fopen(file_path, "rb");
      char *buffer = NULL;
      if (f == NULL) goto error;
      if (fseek(f, 0, SEEK_END) < 0) goto error;

      long m = ftell(f);
      if (m < 0) goto error;

      buffer = malloc((sizeof char) * m);
      if (buffer == NULL) goto error;

      if (fseek(f, 0, SEEK_SET) < 0) goto error;
      size_t n = fread(buffer, 1, m, f);
      assert(n == (size_t) m);

      if (ferror(f)) goto error;
      if (size) *size = n;
      fclose(f);

      return buffer;

     error:
      if (f)      fclose(f);
      if (buffer) free(buffer);
      return NULL;
    }
```

- reading a whole file into a string
  - stat() is not windows portable
  - ftell - to take the value of the cursor
    fseek - to put the cursor to the end of the file
- suffixing ~union~ with _As, AND naming the structure field ~as~, makes it so code will look like this

```c
  Cell.as.text;
  Cell.as.number;
  Cell.as.expr;
```

- When creating unions, make sure that a ~zero initialization~ ({0} or memset()) still gives a valid results for all cases
- using *unions*, *enums* and *structs* together

```c
    typedef enum {
      CELL_KIND_TEXT = 0,
      CELL_KIND_NUMBER,
      CELL_KIND_EXPR,
    } Cell_Kind;

    typedef union {
      String_View text;
      double number;
      Expr expr;
    } Cell_As;

    typedef struct {
      Cell_Kind kind;
      Cell_As as;
    } Cell;
```

- using *macros* to unpack, a hex color (#0xFFAABBCC) into 4 arguments

```c
    #define UNHEX(c) \
      ((c >> 8 * 0) & 0xFF), \
      ((c >> 8 * 1) & 0xFF), \
      ((c >> 8 * 2) & 0xFF), \
      ((c >> 8 * 3) & 0xFF), \
```

- using *macros* to format

```c
    typedef struct {
      int x, y;
    } Vec2;

    #define V2_Fmt "(%d, %d)"
    #define V2_Arg(v) v.x, v.y
```

- strtod() - string to double
- strtof() - string to float

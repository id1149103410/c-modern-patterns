** TODO 18 Threads
- Are another variation of *control flow*
- thrd_create()
  thrd_join() - waits until thread is finished
- "If a thread T0 writes a non-atomic object that is simultaneously read/write by another thread T1,
  the behavior of the execution becomes undefined."

* 20 | Effective C
** 1 Getting Started with C
- C defines 2 possible execution environments:
  - Freestanding: no OS, embedded programming
  - Hosted
- A ~return~ from the initial call to the ~main~ function
  is equivalent to calling ~exit~
- Passing user supplied data to ~printf~ first argument, can result in a secvul (seacord 2013)
- https://github.com/Valloric/YouCompleteMe/
  https://github.com/Shougo/deoplete.nvim/
- Compilers: gcc, clang, visual studio
- Kinds of Portability issues:
  + Implementation-defined behavior: not on the C standard, but on a particular impl
  + Unspecified behavior: on the standard, but with >1 behavior defined
  + Undefined behavior: not on the C standard, explicit or implicit
  + Locale-specific behavior
  + Common Extensions
- ~-pedantic~, notify portability issues
** TODO 2 Objects, Functions, and Types
- "Every type in C is either an ~object~ type or a ~function~ type."
- IEEE 754-2008: the Standard for Floating-Point Arithmetic.
- The ~referenced type~ T derives a ~pointer to~ T
- A code block {} is know as a ~compound statement~
- C is ~call-by-value~ (aka ~pass-by-value~) language
*** Scopes (identifiers)
| file      | declared outside a block or param list             |
| block     | declared inside a block or param list              |
| prototype | on function prototype params                       |
| function  | on function definition, between {}, only labels(?) |
*** Storage duration (lifetime: objects)
|           | life    | default when declared on                                             |
|-----------+---------+----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| automatic | block   | block scope or function parameter                                    |
| static    | program | file scope, must be initialized wth a constant value, not a variable |
| thread    |         |                                                                      |
| allocated |         | (dynamic allocated)                                                  |
*** Alignment
  Number of bytes between suuccessive addresses of objs.
- CPU's might behave differently with aligned or unaligned data
  - They access data by word, and might be able to access multiwords with a perf cost
  - Depending of the CPU's word (16,32,64 bits)
- malloc() is sufficiently aligned for all standard types
- _Alignas(struct S) can be used on C11 to align by the type provided
  In the example for a buffer which is then casted to a struct
- Can be weaker or stronger (aka stricter). Stronger have larger alignment values.
*** Object Types
- Boolean:
  - <stdbool.h>
  _Bool (or just bool) introduced on C99, stores 0 or 1
- Character:
  - char, signed char, unsigned char
  - All have the same alignment, size range, representation, and behavior
  - satisfies a minimum et of characters aka ~basic execution character set~
  - wchar_t is a chart type that takes more space (16 32 bits) to represent more chars
- Numerical:
  - signed char, short int, int, long int, long long int
  - *int* word can be ommited on declaration
  - <limits.h> has the maximun and minumun of each type
  - <inttypes.h> or <stdinit.h> to define uint32_t or uintmax_t
- Enum: enum day {sun = 1, mon, tue}
- Floating-point: float, double, long double
- void
- Functions:
  - list the param types or use *void* when no args
  - A function with a param type list is known as a *function prototype*
- Derived:
  - Pointers:
    - operators &* used together cancell each other
    - * (indirection, operates only on pointers)
    - & (address-of)
  - Arrays:
    - str[i]   is identical to *(str + i)
    - &str[10] is the same as    str + 10
*** TODO Derived Types
*** Tags
- Special naming mechanisms (struct,union,enums)
- Are not a *type name* by itself
- On a different namespace than identifiers
- ~typedef~ define an alias for it
*** Type Qualifiers
| const                 | unmodifiable memory                                                    |
| static volatile       | mmap Inpu/Output                                                       |
| static const volative | mmap Input                                                             |
| restrict              | optimization on pointers, when they are the unique point to the object |
** 5 Control Flow
   - Expression statement
   - Compound statements
   - Statement Kinds:
     1) Selection
     2) Iteration
     3) Jump
*** Expression Statement
    Optional expression, terminated by a (;)
    Most basic unit of work.
    #+begin_src c
    a = 6;
    c = a + b;
    ; // NULL STATEMENT
    ++count;
    #+end_src
    After each full expression has been evaluated,
    its value (if any) is discarded.
*** {}        Compound Statement (or block)
    a list of zero or more statements, surrounded by braces.
    can be nested
    #+begin_src c
    {
      static int count = 0;
      c += a;
      ++count;
    }
    #+end_src
*** if/switch Selection Statements
    allows you to conditionally execute based ona a *controlling expression*
**** if
     - -Wmisleading-indentation, to check for IF indentation when not using braces
      #+begin_src c
      if (expression)
        substatement

      if (expression)
        substatement1
      else
        substatement2

      if (expr1) // if..else ladder
        substatement1
      else if (expr2)
        substatement2
      else
        substatement3

      #+end_src
     *substatement* runs if *expression* is not equal to 0
     - Example
      #+begin_src c
      bool safediv(int dividend, int divisor, int *quotient) {
        if (!quotient) return false;
        if ((divisor == 0) || ((dividend == INT_MIN) && (divisor == -1)))
          return false;
        *quotient = dividend / divisor;
        return true;
      }
      #+end_src
**** switch
     expression MUST have an *integer* type
     Integer promotions are performed on the *controlling expression*
     The *constant* expression in each *case* label is converted to the promoted type.
     -Wimplicit-fallthrough
     -Wswitch-enum
     #+begin_src c
     switch (marks/10) {
       case 10: // Falls through
       case 9:
         puts("YOUR GRADE : A");
         break;
       default:
         puts("YOUR GRADE : FAILED");
     }
     #+end_src
     remember, enums map to integers
     if you not provide a default, and nothing matches, nothing wil run
     #+begin_src c
     typedef enum { Saving, Checking, MoneyMarket } AccountType;
     void assignInterestRate(AccountType account) {
       double interest_rate;
       switch (account) {
         case Savings:
           interest_rate = 3.0;
           break;
         case Checking:
           interest_rate = 1.0;
           break;
         case MoneyMarket:
           interest_rate = 4.5;
           break;
         default: abort();
       }
       printf("Interest rate = %g.\n", interest_rate);
     }
     #+end_src
     abort(), declared in the stdlib.h
*** while/for Iteration statement
    AKA loops, "a process, the end of which is connected to the beginning"
**** while
     runs until the controlling expression is equal to 0
     a simple *entry-controlled* loop
     - Example:
       1) copies the *val* converted to uchar
       2) into the first *n* characters
       3) of the object pointed by *dest*
     #+begin_src c
     void *memset(void *dest, int val, size_t n) {
       unsigned char *ptr = (unsigned char*)dest;
       while (n-- > 0)
         *ptr++ = (unsigned char)val;
       return dest;h
     }
     #+end_src
** 10 Program Structure
- Decompose your program into a collection of components that exchange information
  aross a shared boundary, or interface.
- Aim: low copling and high cohesion
- ~Cohesion~ measure of commonality between elements on a interface.
- ~Coupling~ measure of interdependency of programming interfaces
  - You can benefit from structuring your code as a collection of libraries.
    Even if the components aren't turned into actual libraries.
- ~Code Reuse~ functions, an interface, must struck a balance between generality and specificity. To allow for future changes.
- ~Data Abstractions~ enforces clear separation between the public interface and the implementation details.
- ~Opaque Types~ provide incomplete types on public interfaces
  typedef struct collection_type collectin_type;
  Defines a pointer to the type needed, instead of an actual value type.
  Internal header file, would define the type fully.
- Static compiled code can be further optimized for your program's use.
  Unused library code can be stripped from the final executable.
*** Linkage
| external  | by default at file level                                          |
| internal  | explicit *static* at file level                                   |
| nolinkage | variable at block level (static gives it static storage duration) |
* 22 | Beej's Guide to Network Programming
** 2 What is a socket?
- ~socket()~ creates the fd
- use it with ~recv/send~ calls
- you can use ~read/write~, but they have less control over data transmission
- Types of Internet Sockets (more)
  1) raw sockets
  2) stream sockets   | SOCK_STREAM | TCP | RFC 793
     - connect()
     - ordered
     - "error free"
     - send()
  3) datagram sockets | SOCK_DGRAM | UDP | RFC 768
     - no guarantees of: order, arrival
     - "error free"
     - sendto()
** 3 Ip Addresses, *structs*, and Data Munging
- ipv6
  - in hexadecimal representation
  - each two-byte chunk separated by a colon
  - :: for "compressing" zeros, either in the middle, or at the edges
  - ipv4 into an ipv6 notation
    ::fff:192.0.2.33
  - 2001:0db8:c9d2:aee5:73e3:934a:a5ae:9551
    ::1
  - has a "netmask" style with a slash
    2001:db8::/32
    2001:db8:5413:4028::9db9/64
- Big-Endian: ordered
  - subtypes:
    - Network Byte Order
    - Host Byte Order
- Little-Endian: reverse order
- Types of number to convert
  | short | 2(two) bytes  |
  | long  | 4(four) bytes |
- You just assume the endianess is wrong and run the value through a function to set it as NBO
  =htons()= (aka "Host To Network Short")
- You'll want to cgonver the number sto NBO before they go out on the wire.
  And convert them to HBO as they come in off the wire.
- ipv6 has private networks too, in a sense. They'll start with ~fdXX:~ (perhaps ~fcXX:~ too in the future)
  RFC4193
*** structs
**** addrinfo
- used to prep the socket address structures for subsequent use
- used in host name lookups
- used in service name lookups
- used by =getaddrinfo()=, which will return a pointer to a NEW linked list of these structure
  BUT filled out with all the goodies you need.
- AF_UNSPEC to use whatever, aka ip version-agnostic
  linked list because we can receive many results
- before this struct existed, you needed to package all this stuff by hand
#+begin_src c
  struct addrinfo {
    int ai_flags; // AI_PASSIVE, AI_CANONNAME, etc
    int ai_family; // AF_INET, AF_INET6, AF_UNSPEC
    int ai_socktype; // SOCK_STREAM, SOCK_DGRAM
    int ai_protocol; // 0 for "any"
    size_t ai_addlen; // size of ai_addr in bytes
    struct sockaddr *ai_addr; // struct sockaddr_in or _in6
    char *ai_canonname; // full canonical hostname
    struct addrinfo *ai_next; // linked list, next node
  }
#+end_src
**** sockaddr
- sa_data contains a destination address and port number for the socket
#+begin_src c
  struct sockaddr
  {
    unsigned short sa_family;   // address family, AF_INET, AF_INET6, AF_XXX
    char           sa_data[14]; // 14 bytes of protocol address
  };
#+end_src
**** sockaddr_in
- IPV4 only
- "in" for internet
- created to deal with "struct sockaddr"
- can be cast to and from "struct sockaddr"
- sin_zero should be set to zeroes with memset()
- sin_port in NBO (use htons())
#+begin_src c
  struct sockaddr_in
  {
    short int          sin_family;  // address family, AF_INET
    unsigned short int sin_port;    // port number
    struct in_addr     sin_addr;    // internet address
    unsigned char      sin_zero[8]; // padding
  };
#+end_src
**** in_addr
- it used to be an union
- saddr in NBO
#+begin_src c
  struct in_addr
  {
    uint32_t saddr; // that's a 32-bit int (4 bytes)
  };
#+end_src
**** sockaddr_in6
#+begin_src c
  struct sockaddr_in6
  {
    u_int16_t       sin6_family;   // address family, AF_INET6
    u_int16_t       sin6_port;     // port number, NBO
    u_int32_t       sin6_flowinfo; // ipv6 flow information
    struct in6_addr sin6_addr;     // ipv6 address
    u_int32_t       sin6_scope_id; // scope id
  };
#+end_src
**** in6_addr
#+begin_src c
  struct in6_addr
  {
    unsigned char s6_addr[16]; // ipv6 address
  };
#+end_src
**** sockaddr_storae
- designed to be large enough to hold both ipv4 and ipv6 struct
- due for some calls you don't know in advance if it's going to be fill out your struct sockaddr with ipv4 or ipv6 address.
- you check the ss_family field, then cast it out to sockaddr_in or sockaddr_in6
#+begin_src c
  struct sockaddr_storage
  {
    sa_family_t ss_family; // address family

    // all this is padding, implementation specific, ignore it
    char    __ss_pad1[_SS_PAD1_SIZE];
    int64_t __ss_align;
    char    __ss_pad2[_SS_PAD2_SIZE];
  };
#+end_src
*** Ip Addresses, Part Deux
**** inet_pton() - Presentation To Network (aka Printable To Network)
- returns
  - -1 on error
  - 0 if the address is messed up
- converst an ip address in numbers-and-dots notation into either, depending of the AF_NET? you specify
  1) struct in_addr
  2) struct in6_addr
#+begin_src c
  struct sockaddr_in sa;
  struct sockaddr_in6 sa6;
  inet_pton(AF_INET, "10.12.110.57", &(sa.sin_addr));
  inet_pton(AF_INET6, "2001:db8:63b3:1::3490", &(sa6.sin6.addr));
#+end_src
**** DEPRECATED: inet_addr() & inet_aton()
- the old way of doing things
- won't work with ipv6
**** inet_ntop() - Network To Presentation (aka Network To Printable)
- ipv4
  #+begin_src c
    char ip4[INET_ADDRSTRLEN]; // space to hold the ipv4 string
    struct sockaddr_in sa;     // pretend this is loaded with something
    inet_ntop(AF_INET,
              &(sa.sin_addr),
              ip4,
              INET_ADDRSTRLEN);
    printf("The ipv4 address is: %s\n", ip4);
  #+end_src
- ipv6
  #+begin_src c
    char ip6[INET6_ADDRSTRLEN];
    struct sockaddr_in6 sa6;
    inet_ntop(AF_INET6, &(sa6.sin6_addr), ip6, INET6_ADDRSTRLEN);
    printf("The address is: %s\n", ip6);
  #+end_src
**** DEPRECATED: inet_ntoa()
- won't work with ipv6
** 4 Jumping from IPv4 to IPv6
1) =getaddinfo()= to get a all the ~struct sockaddr~ info, this will keep you IP version-agnostic, and avoid below steps
2) If you are hardcoding a version, try to wrap it up in a helper function
3) AF_INET to AF_INET6
   PF_INET to PF_INET6
4) change assignments
   sa.sin_addr.s_addr = INADDR_ANY
   sa6.sin6_addr = in6addr_any
5) use initializer for in6_addr
   struct in6_addr ia6 = IN6ADDR_ANY_INIT
6) change struct sockaddr_in to sockaddr_in6
7) change struct in_addr to in6_addr
8) instead of inet_aton/inet_addr use inet_pton
9) instead of inet_ntoa use inet_ntop
10) instead of gethostbyname() use getaddrinfo()
11) instead of gethostbyaddr() use getnameinfo()
12) INADDR_BROADCAST no longer works
** 5 System Calls or Bust
- getaddrinfo() + socket() + setsockopt + bind() + listen() + accept()
- getaddrinfo() + socket() + connect()
*** getaddrinfo(node, service, hints, res)
#+begin_src c
  int getaddrinfo(const char *node,    // eg: "www.example.com" or IP
                  const char *service, // eg: "http" or port number like "80"
                  const struct addrinfo *hints,
                  struct addrinfo **res);
#+end_src
- helps setup the sturcts you need later on
- DEPRECATES ~gethostbyname()~ to do DNS lookups.
  Which then you needed to fill the struct sockaddr_in by hand.
- you give it 3 input parameters, and it gives you a pointer to a linked-list, res of results
- AI_PASSIVE tells it to assign the address of my local host to the structure socket structures
- =freeaddrinfo()= - frees dynamically allocated memory from a linked list (struct addrinfo **res)
- =gai_strerror()= - translate error codes into human readable ones
**** Example: server who wants to listen
#+begin_src c
  int status;
  struct addrinfo hints;
  struct addrinfo *servinfo;       // will point to the results
  memset(&hints, 0, sizeof hints); // make sure the struct is empty
  hints.ai_family = AF_UNSPEC;     // don't care ipv4 or ipv6
  hints.ai_socktype = SOCK_STREAM; // tcp
  hints.ai_flags = AI_PASSIVE;     // fill in my IP for me
  if ((status = getaddrinfo(NULL, "3490", &hints, &servinfo)) != 0) {
    fprintf(stderr, "getaddrinfo error", gai_strerror(status));
    exit(1);
   }
  // ... when you don't need it anymore
  freeaddrinfo(servinfo);
#+end_src
**** Example: Client who wants to connect
#+begin_src c
  int status;

#+begin_src c

  socketfd = socket(res->ai_family, res->ai_socktype, res->ai_protocol);
  connect(sockfd, res->ai_addr, res->ai_addrlen);
#+end_src
- returns -1 on error, and sets ~errno~
- no bind()
- Old programs filled out their own struct sockaddr_in to pass to connect()
*** listen  (fd, backlog)
#+begin_src c
  int listen(int sockfd,
             int backlog); // number of connections allowed on the incoming queue
#+end_src
- backlog: incoming connections are goint to wait in this queue until you =accept()=
  - 20 is common value, you can use 5 or 10
- returns -1 on error and set ~errno~
- you need to call bind() before listen, so that the server listens on a ip/port
*** accept  (fd, addr, addrlen)
#+begin_src c
  #incluse <sys/types.h>
  #include <sys/socket.h>
  int accept(int sockfd,            // socket fd listen()ing
             struct sockaddr *addr, // incoming connection information to be filled
             socklen_t *addrlen);   // integer, sizeof(struct sockaddr_storage)
#+end_src
- won't put more bytes on ~addr~ than those on ~addrlen~,
  if put less it'll change the value of ~addrlen~
- it will _return_ a brand new socket file descriptor to use for this single connection
  - returns -1 and sets errno on, error
- if you are listening for only 1(one) connection EVER, you can _close()_ the listen()ing socket
**** Example
#+begin_src c

#+end_src
- for stream sockets OR connected datagram sockets
- returns
  - the number of bytes _actually send_ out, might be less that what you told it to send
    it's up to you to send the rest later (less than 1K should be fine)
  - OR -1 and sets ~errno~ on error
*** recv    (fd, buf,  len, flags)
#+begin_src c

           int len,    // maximum lenght of the buffer

#+end_src
- returns
  - number of bytes actually read into the buffer
  - or -1 with errno set, on error
  - or 0, if the remote side has closed the connection on you
*** sendto  (fd, msg,  len, flags, to,   tolen)

             socklen_t tolen); // sizeof *to OR sizeof(struct sockaddr_storage)
#+end_src
- for regular _unconnected_ datagram sockets
- you get the destination address either from
  1) getaddrinfo()
  2) recvfrom()
  3) or you'll fill it out by hand
- returns
  - bytes actually sent, might be less that you told it
  - or -1 on error
*** recvfrom(fd, buf,  len, flags, from, fromlen)
#+begin_src c
  int recvfrom(int sockfd,

               int *fromlen); // should be initialized to sizeof *from OR sizeof(struct sockaddr_storage), will be updated
#+end_src
- for regular _unconnected_ datagram sockets
- returns
  - number of bytes received
  - or -1 and ~errno~ on error
- from
  - sockaddr_storage will be enough for both ipv4 and ipv6
*** close   (fd)
- both ways
- will prevent any more reads and writes to the socket, anyone trying will get an error
- closesocket() on windows
*** shutdown(fd, how)
- It does NOT actually close the FD, it just changes its usability
  to free a FD you need to use close()
- returns
 |  0 | on success          |
 | -1 | and errno, on error |
- how
 | 0 | further receives are disallowed                          |
 | 1 | further sends are disallowed                             |
 | 2 | further sends and receives are disallowed (like close()) |

                  int *addrlen);         // sizeof *addr OR sizeof(struct sockaddr)
#+end_src
- tells you who is at the other side of a connect()ed stream socket
- return
  - -1 and errno, on error
- later you can use either, to print or get more information
  1) inet_ntop()
  2) getnameinfo()
  3) gethostbyaddr()
*** gethostname(hostname, size)
#+begin_src c
  #include <unistd.h>
  int gethostname(char *hostname,
                  size_t size); // the length in BYTES of the hostname array
#+end_src
- returns the name of the computer that your program is running on
  - can later be used by =gethostbyname()= to determine the IP address of your machine
- returns
  - 0 on sucessful completion
  - -1 and errno on error
** 6 Client-Server Background
*** 6.1 A simple Stream Server
- server will wait for a connection, accept()it and fork() a child process to handle it
- perror() to handle errno stuff
- waitpid() - suspends the execution of the calling thread until thread changes state
  - with PID -1 it waits for any child process
- signal usage to "reap dead processes"
  - struct sigaction
  - sigemptyset()
  - sigaction()
- fork
  - returns
    - to the parent, the pid of the child process or -1
    - to the child, 0

** 7 Slightly Advanced Techniques
*** fcntl()  - Blocking
- techie jargon for ~sleep~
- lots of functions block, because they are allowed to
  - accept()
  - recv()
- you can make the socket non-blocking with =fcntl()=
  #+begin_src c
    #include <unistd.h>
    #include <fcntl.h>
    sockfd = socket(PF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0);
    fcntl(sockfd, FSETFL, O_NONBLOCK);
  #+end_src
- now you can effectively "poll" the socket for information
  - things that blocked now will _return_ -1 and errno to EAGAIN or EWOULDBLOCK (check both)
  - a naive polling based on the return code will be ~busy-wait~ work for the CPU
  - instead use poll()
*** poll()   - Synchronous IO Multiplexing
#+begin_src c
  #include <poll.h>
  int poll(struct pollfd fds[], // array of information
           nfds_t nfds,         // count of elements in the array
           int timeout);        // in milliseconds, negative for FOREVER
#+end_src
- WHY?
  - monitor a _bunch of sockets_ at once and then handle the ones that have data ready
  - without actively poll every socket to know which are ready to read
- returns
  - the number of elements in the array that have had an event occur
- SLOW for giant numbers of connections, use libevent in that case https://libevent.org/
- we ask the OS to tell us when a socket is ready
  meanwhile our process can go to sleep
- the OS will block on the =poll()= until:
  1) 1(one) of those events occurs
  2) or a user specified timeout occurs
- keep an array of ~struct pollfds~, with information about
  1) which _socket_ descriptors we want to monitor
  2) and which kind of _events_ we want to monitor
- If we want to _add a new socket_ descript to the set I passed to poll
  1) make sure you have enough space on the array
  2) or realloc()
- If we want to _delete an item_ from the set, either
  * copy the last element in the array over-top the one you are deleting
    then pass in one fewer as the count to poll()
  * you can set the fd field to anegateive number and poll() will ignore it
**** struct pollfd
- events field is the bitwise-OR of
 | POLLIN  | alert me when data is ready to recv()                           |
 | POLLOUT | alert me when i can send() data to this socket without blocking |
#+begin_src c
  struct pollfd {
    int fd;        // the socket descriptor
    short events;  // bitmap of events we are interested in
    short revents; // when poll() returns, bitmap of events that occurred
  };
#+end_src
**** Example: simple use of poll() with STDIN
#+begin_src c
  #include <poll.h>
  #include <stdio.h>
  #include <sys/poll.h>

  int main(void) {

    struct pollfd pfds[1];
    pfds[0].fd = 0;          // Standard Input
    pfds[0].events = POLLIN; // Tell me when ready to read

    printf("Hit RETURN or wait 2.5 seconds for timeout\n");

    int num_events = poll(pfds, 1, 2500);
    if (num_events == 0)
      printf("Poll timed out!\n");
    else {
      int pollin_happened = pfds[0].revents & POLLIN;
      if (pollin_happened)
        printf("File descriptor %d is ready to read\n", pfds[0].fd);
      else
        printf("Unexpected event occurred: %d\n", pfds[0].revents);
    }
